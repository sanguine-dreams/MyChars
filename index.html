        <p>Tabletop Roleplaying Games, or as they are often called TTRPG are Roleplaying games that you only really need two things to play: Dice, and creativity. Or as it is often called, Theater of The Mind. They involve a Dungeon Master, or a Game Master, who is in charge of the storytelling and rulekeeping. Every game system comes with its own rulebook that details the method of play. For example, in 5th edition Dungeons and Dragons, you select a race, a class, and spend points depending on what you want to be good at. There are six major ones, 3 physical traits and 3 mental traits. Wisdom, Charisma, and Intelligence. Dexterity, Strength, and Constituion. I'll refrain from reiterating <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/marketplace/sourcebooks/players-handbook" target="_blank" class="Player" > The Player Handbook. </a>

        Tabletop Games are a favorite hobby of mine. Thus, I thought I could use what I know in HTML and CSS to cobble together personalised Character Sheets for all my tabletop characters. The purpose of these is thematic and aesthetic, far more than it is meant to be informative. While it can be, that was not the point. 
        <br> 
        Willow's sheet is calm, lets you know everything about her and her companions. She is upfront.  <br>
        Vel's character derives from what she can do, and not simply her personality or relationship with others, thus I have included stats.  <br>
        Aerlith is a very old elf, trying to summarize her is a useless task, a highlight of important events was far more reasonable.  <br>
        Wyatt is illiterate, and speaks very little. He would not tell you about himself, you may only percieve him and be confused.  <br>
        Datura is an assassin, very much embodying ''If I tell you, I'll have to kill you.''.
