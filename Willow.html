<h1>Physical Appearance </h1>
<p> Willow is an 8’9 Firbolg with pale pink skin coloration and patches of skin that spread out in white from vitiligo that spreads into strands of her hair. Her red, curly hair is usually pulled back into a braid that never stays throughout the day and she always ends up with loose strands poking out by midday. Her eyes resemble those of deer with rectangular irises. Her nose is a far deeper pink that extends down to the upper lip, with the lower lip much paler in comparison. She is muscular and well built, carrying many scars across her body and face. Specifically a scar on the left side of her face, missing her eye and lip in a titled line, but the damage is clear with a missing tip of her left ear. </p>


<h1> Background</h1>
<p> Willow’s home was once far closer to the diverse islands surrounding Melora’s ever-storming island. Hers was not so big, not so small, a nondescript green forest. Full of tall trees and sprawling rivers of rushing water. It didn’t really have a name, she just called it ‘Home’. As it was. There was nothing odd about the way she grew up in her home, she was the same as everyone else, albeit a little more hot-headed than her friends and family. Specifically, an older brother that she never really got along with. Polar opposite personalities often clashed, resulting in only Willow losing her temper as he was a far calmer than the two. He was also far smaller than her, in both build and strength.

  <br>

  Their island was often boarded by ships needing temporary harbor, and oftentimes they did not respect the laws of the land and nature. They would cut down what they need and kill recklessly to restock- something that Willow always suggested should be stopped with more aggression than the usual scare-tactics the tribe would utilise. A point of great dispute with her brother- who often helped them. His reasoning was; They needed supplies, helping them get them properly was far better than any needless aggression or letting them ruin the space around them. Willow believed that that would just lead to the tribe being used and the nature undermined, This came to a head one day in a screaming match between the two of them, raised voices and ugly words being exchanged between the two of them. This attracted the attention of the rest of the tribe and some members, accustomed to this, came to break up the fight. However, as they arrived, they found the older sibling tumbling down the quick current river, headed fast to the astral sea and Willow knees deep in the water. She was quickly pulled out from the river, as she had attempted to wade further in, risking being washed away as well. Despite her protests, she was not allowed to reach out for him and bring him out into the water, and the water carried his body into the astral sea. 
  <br>
  It was an accident. However, the words never escaped her lips, in fact, her silence condemned her in the following days as her parents and kin questioned her, poking and prodding for an explanation but she could not provide one, washed in guilt. What made matters worse, was that when she was eventually asked if she had killed him, she could not answer in nothing but tears. This was the cause of her exile, for murder, it was ruled, as she never denied it. The tribe leaders had ruled that she was reckless and a danger to the safety of their way of life, even if the death had been accidental- that exile was the kinder choice, for everyone involved. 
  <br>
  And thus, Willow camped out by the shore for weeks, till one of those ships she had always wanted to attack landed on their shore and she was granted passage. From her Home, to the next island, and the next, and the next. Doing jobs from sweeping decks to dealing with minor crew injuries here and there. Eventually, landing in a city far far away from anything she was accustomed to. Greenery was restricted to decorative gardens and out of living spaces. Everything was stone and dead wood. Life revolved around gold and its accumulation, it was something she...hated. 
  <br>
  Willow lived this life she detested for many years, occasionally leaving one island to the next but it seemed wherever ships went, it was to places of trade and those were all the same. Nature being used as nothing but a source of income rather than a home and shelter, gold ruling all men. 
  <br>
  First, it was simple acts of sabotage, stealing bird cages to free them, releasing show animals in the night and guiding them to safety, burning down a circus-
  That one might not have been small, and she would have been caught had the guard that caught her not been a half orc, about as equally sick of the circus’ displays of cruelty. In fact, he struck his sword at the cage beside him, breaking the lock that kept a Loxodon all locked up. Willow and the Loxodon, along with several other circus escapees hid that night in the nearby nature, with the help of the Loxodon who turned out to be a druid. 
  Days later, they were found by none other than that same guard, here without a uniform and with a promise of a smuggling ship to get them all out. 
  <br>
  They escaped, and spread out into the world, but the Loxodon named Yasna and the Half- Orc named Kurud stayed with her. They wanted to do this again. And so they did, and their crew grew. They realized that they needed different skills, that none of them were really the inconspicuous type, or really the intelligent type- not the intelligent it takes to carry out plans against companies and factories like they wanted. So they found themselves a face, a Changeling Bard by the name of Tic. Tic could lie and sneak and change their face but they weren’t very good at stealing keys or opening locks, and so they found an Air Genasi that liked to go by the name Whistle, there was nowhere she couldn’t sneak into. However, they struggled to find someone both smart and trustworthy till they met Tetgar. Tetgar was a Minotaur that got himself thrown in a jail cell after using magic to make his bar brawl opponent shit his pants. After bailing him out, mostly because Willow and Whistle found his act absolutely hilarious and deserving of reward, not punishment, they found out he was a Wizard without a place to call home. Taking a gamble on him, they explained their anti-establishment efforts to him and he was convinced before they could even finish. And thus, they were complete.
