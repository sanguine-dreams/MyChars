        I have always been one to journal and document my days. I supposed I used these pages to vent words I would not otherwise say out loud. Later, it became a way of keeping track of all the insane things I was doing. I didn’t want to miss a thing when I retold the wild tales… 
        <br>

Today I would like to summarize. The things I write, you likely already know. If you did not, well… it soon won’t matter that you do. 
<br>

My name is Datura. I am a Shadowscale, although a Lukiel- some will very quickly point out. I was born with a deformity on my right leg that made physical strain a nightmare and training at Archon torture. But I wasn’t alone, the man who would become my father, a Dark Brotherhood member,  was studying alchemy there to improve his craft. He saw a daughter in me and I’m eternally grateful. He trained me in poison, which I crafted medicine out of, fit only for Argonians like myself. 
<br>
This allowed me to prove myself enough that Archon let me follow the Dark Brotherhood Assassin to his sanctuary. We lived in Bravil, and I finally found some relative peace. I worked on my craft, developed new skills. Till news of the Purification of the Cheydinhal Sanctuary arrived. 
<br>
I moved there, an Assassin rank taking up the mantle of an Executioner- with none of the respect. It was tiring, thankless work. That is why once they no longer needed me, I decided to take a trip and explore Tamriel. I had never really been outside the dank caverns of Bravil and the swamps of Archon much. It was a good opportunity. 
<br>
I immediately came across adventures, out on a prophecy to Azura herself. I should have walked the other bloody way. 
<br>
Alas, we slaughtered minotaurs, I stole away a baby minotaur to the Brotherhood’s ranks- they still think I sold her. Then we time travelled! It sounds as odd writing it as it was experiencing it. Several dead Daedric champions, a failed relationship, and a chopped off leg later-  it was over. I got a beautiful ring out of it, it suits me well. I believe it may not have been the leg that made me grotesque, but my hist-less soul. 

<br><br>
-Dearly yours, Executioner Datura
